**What is a save editor?**

A Save Editor is a tool to read the data from a file and modify them easily with a graphical interface.
Everything that can be done in game can be done in a Save Editor, the illegal content can be unlocked but everything that can't be possible in game (example in IEGOCS: recruit more than 336 players) can't be done in the tool.

**What is the project**

Inazuma Eleven Save Editor is a project to create an application that can read and modify the saves of the games of the main series. It's more lite than the old Save Editor Inazuma Eleven (NoFarmForMe), because all "gimmicks" functions was removed. The Tool is written in C# and the project is Open Source, everyone can contribute.
